# Expense Manager Application

## Description
> That's a solution for simple expense management. The idea behind of this application, for now, is simply to attend my personal need of managing my expenses, since that I already do it, but manually. The primary concept is very simple. The idea is to import, in the beginning, CSV files and Excel spreadsheets as well (using Apache POI) into a DBMS, for further consulting, analysis and so on.

> In spite of the simplicity, the challenge is to build the converters which will transform the bank exported files into entities, allowing their addition into the DBMS. Some Brazillian banks has the challenge of demanding the definition of different converter models, because the same account, can have different Excel spreadsheet formats, depending of the date interval selected for exporting only.

## Points to be covered by the solution
> Since that it is currently in its very beginning, I am now designing the application itself, where I will be updating this document soon.
